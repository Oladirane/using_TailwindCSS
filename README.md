# using_TailwindCSS
I replicated this portfolio website using tailwind CSS. It was done to test my knowledge about Tilwind CSS
After i developed this porfolio website, i found Tailwind CSS to be very much interesting and i think i will be making use of it most times now.
My main reason of the love for Tailwind CSS is that it made resposive designs easy and fast without having to know the different screen sizes.
